# JS-8th--TODO-list
## Simple TO-DO List. (Based JS)
Tools:    
Bootstrap,       
LocalStorage,    
JSON.stringify,   
JSON.parse,    
GLOBAL OBJECT: window.(our function), 
e.preventDefault,      
DOM elements were built with JS.   


### Task:    
*Get hands-on experience working with events and modifying existing code.  

*Learn how to build web applications with the TODO application example.    

step 1:   
Write the correct code for the TODO application.   

step 2:   
Make the form button disabled when the input field is empty.    

step 3:   
Each created task must be stored in the task array as an object. When creating a new task, a new object with three parameters should be added to the array: name, done - the status of the task (true or false) and id.   

step 4:   
Make, when you click on "Delete" button,will deleted not only "DOM li element" from the DOM tree but also the object from TODO array. And make the same with the "DONE" button.      

step 5:   
Create a function to store an "TODO array" in localStorage. Call that function every time you change the TODO list.    

step 6:   
Make, when launched the app in the "createTodoApp () func", check the data in localStorage if present.
If there is data in localStorage, decrypt it. And render the result on screen like DOM elements of the TODO list.
